# mx.crypto 0.2.2

* Release the cross-signing, forwarded Megolm, and SAS primitives added in
  development versions 0.2.1.1 and 0.2.1.2. No code changes since 0.2.1.2.

# mx.crypto 0.2.1.2

* New: ephemeral SAS key agreement, display-byte derivation, and constant-time
  MAC verification through vodozemac. SAS handles reject wrong pointer types,
  low-order peer keys, and repeated use of an ephemeral secret. Protocol
  orchestration and durable user trust remain in mx.client.

* New: SHA-256 SAS commitments use sha2 0.10.9, now declared directly.
  This crate was already bundled and locked through vodozemac; no vendored
  source bytes or R dependencies were added.

# mx.crypto 0.2.1.1

* New: `mxc_signing_key_*()` provides durable Ed25519 signing keys for
  Matrix cross-signing. Private state uses the same encrypted pickle format
  and 32-byte local store key as device accounts.
* New: `mxc_megolm_inbound_export()`,
  `mxc_megolm_inbound_import()`, and `mxc_megolm_inbound_info()` implement
  the cryptographic half of `m.forwarded_room_key`, preserving the first
  known message index and marking imported sessions unverified as required
  by Megolm.

# mx.crypto 0.2.1

* `tools/configure.R` picks the Rust target on Windows from the running
  R rather than from the host triple: `aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm` on
  ARM64, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm` for clang-compiled R,
  `i686-pc-windows-gnu` on 32-bit, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` otherwise.
  It is passed as `--target` whenever it differs from the host. Fixes
  the build on Windows ARM64. Thanks to Jeroen Ooms (#3).
* On a Windows GNU host building for itself, the Rust build stays
  native and keeps `-C link-self-contained=yes`. Passing `--target`
  stops cargo applying `RUSTFLAGS` to build scripts and proc-macros,
  which leaves them unexecutable on the Rtools toolchain.

# mx.crypto 0.2.0

* **HIGH** (security): `mxc_olm_create_outbound()` now propagates
  vodozemac's `SessionCreationError` instead of silently encoding a
  `Result` as a `Session` external pointer. The previous behavior
  meant a non-contributory Diffie-Hellman key (Soatok 2026-02
  disclosure, fixed in vodozemac 0.10.0 itself) returned a corrupt
  pointer that produced undefined behavior on use.
* New: `mxc_ed25519_verify()`, `mxc_verify_device_keys()`,
  `mxc_verify_one_time_key()` so callers can validate
  homeserver-supplied device-keys and signed one-time keys before
  using them. Hostile-fixture tests cover every rejection branch.
* New: `SECURITY.md` (threat model, pinned dependency status, pickle
  hygiene, known limitations).
* New: vignette `security-audit` walking the audit findings.
* DESCRIPTION: `mx.api (>= 0.1.0.1)` and `simplermarkdown` added to
  `Suggests`; `VignetteBuilder: simplermarkdown`.

# mx.crypto 0.1.0

* Initial release.
* Wraps the 'vodozemac' Rust crate (Matrix.org) for Olm + Megolm.
* Account: identity keys, one-time keys, fallback keys, signing,
  pickle / unpickle.
* Olm sessions: outbound and inbound creation, encrypt, decrypt,
  pickle / unpickle.
* Megolm group sessions: outbound (sender) and inbound (receiver)
  creation, encrypt, decrypt, pickle / unpickle.
* Pure crypto only; HTTP transport lives in the 'mx.api' package.
* Out of scope for 0.1.0: room-key requests / forwarded keys,
  cross-signing, SAS verification.
